# react-redux-todo
A simple todo list project using react, redux with an express backend.
This project is highly inspired by the [MERN Project](https://github.com/Hashnode/mern-starter).

# Running the application
Clone the project, and run the following command:
```
npm start
```
This will run nodemon to monitor the files during development and start 
an express web server with a webpack middleware for bundling and other 
nifty development tricks.
